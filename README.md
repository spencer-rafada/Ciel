# Overview

As a Software Engineer, I strive to develop my skills in programming by being proficient
in different languages that will allow me to be marketable to different companies. On this project,
my goal was to learn the language Java and technicalities of Object-Oriented Programming.

Ciel is 2D game about a kid named *Ciel* who learns to develop skills such as gardening.

In this software, I wrote different SuperClasses and subclasses that **extends** from the parent class.
Games are programmed in OOP and this game is not an exemption. There are different classes to check collisions,
set objects, set the map, entity classes, and more. I manipulated data within classes through methods.

The purpose for writing this software is to learn Java, OOP, and 2D Game Development. Most of the 
code here came from a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq). However,
I added unique objects different from the tutorial which furthered my knowledge in OOP.
